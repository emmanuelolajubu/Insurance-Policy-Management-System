Welcome to our policy management system! This system is designed to help insurance companies manage their policyholders, products, and payments efficiently.

Class Separation

Our system has three main classes:

- Policyholder: Represents individual policyholders, with details like name and email.
- Product: Represents different insurance products, with details like name and premium.
- Payment: Represents payments made by policyholders, with details like payment date and amount.

Policyholder Management

Policy managers can perform the following actions:

- Register new policyholders: Create new policyholder accounts with their details.
- Suspend policyholders: Temporarily suspend policyholders if needed.
- Reactivate suspended policyholders: Re-enable suspended policyholders.

Product Management

Policy managers can also:

- Create new policy products: Add new insurance products with their details.
- Update product details: Modify existing product details, like price or name.
- Suspend or reactivate products: Temporarily or permanently remove products from sale.

Payment Processing

The system handles payment processing, allowing policyholders to make payments and update their accounts accordingly.
